# Part 2

# 1. Determine the number of protein sequences in the chloroplast.
# This command returns a count of all the lines that begin with the > symbol, which gives us a count of protein sequences.
grep -c "^>" Coffee_genome_chloroplast.fasta

# 2. Create a file of all the names of protein sequences in Coffee plant's chloroplast sequences.
# This pipeline creates the file and uses the grep command to write the protein names to it.
touch Coffee_chloroplast_proteins.txt | grep -n "Coarcp" Coffee_genome_chloroplast.fasta | grep -Eo '[^>]+$' > Coffee_chloroplast_proteins.txt

#3. How many photosystem subunits are present in the chromosome?
# This command determines the number of proteins present that contain the phrase "photosystem."
grep -ci "photosystem" Coffee_chloroplast_proteins.txt

#4 Make a .fasta file for ATP synthase CF 1 beta subunit protein sequence.
# This pipeline creates the new file and copies the desired lines into the new file.
touch ATP_synthase_CF_1_beta_subunit.fasta | sed -n '57p' Coffee_genome_chloroplast.fasta > ATP_synthase_CF_1_beta_subunit.fasta | sed -n '58p' Coffee_genome_chloroplast.fasta >> ATP_synthase_CF_1_beta_subunit.fasta
