Paper Airplane Directions
These directions require standard 8x11 letter paper

First, fold the paper in half so that it is 4x11.
Next, unfold the paper and fold the two upper corners to the crease from the previous fold.
Now, take the bottom corner of the triangular fold and fold to the central crease on both sides of the paper.
Refold the paper along the original crease.
Fold both sides in half.

Your paper airplane is ready to fly.
